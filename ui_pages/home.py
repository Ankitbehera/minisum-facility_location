            Facility Location and Design is a core subject in **Operations Research**
            and **Industrial & Systems Engineering**, concerned with determining
            optimal locations for facilities such as warehouses, manufacturing plants,
            hospitals, fire stations, and service centers. These decisions directly
            impact system efficiency, service quality, and long-term operational cost,
            making them strategically important in both public and private sectors.

            ### Objective of the Application

            This application serves as a **one-stop educational platform** for
            understanding fundamental and advanced concepts in **Facility Location
            and Design**.

            The app is primarily intended for **conceptual learning and academic
            exploration**. It is designed to work with **small datasets**, enabling 
            users to clearly interpret results and relate them
            to theoretical principles discussed in class.

            The application is organized into multiple modules, each corresponding
            to a specific category of facility location problems. Through these
            modules, users can:
            - Interactively input and modify problem data  
            - Apply classical analytical and algorithmic solution approaches  
            - Visualize optimal locations, solution regions, and cost structures  
            - Compare outcomes across different distance measures and models  

            This interactive experimentation helps bridge the gap between
            **theoretical formulations** and **practical interpretation**.

            ### Acknowledgement

            This application was developed based on concepts and material covered
            in the course **Facility Location and Design** taught by **Prof. J. K. Jha**
            at **IIT Kharagpur**. The lecture notes and classroom discussions were
            used as the primary academic reference for this work.
